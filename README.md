> ‚Åâ The piece move makes some delay not because of the code, but because of the speed of the host. The server is hosted on render's free plan.

### Tech Stack 

The server is built with Express & socket.io, and the frontend is built with Next.js, Sass and the following modules:

- `react-chessboard` for piece drag-and-drop functionality
- `chess.js (v0.13.4)` for piece move validation and more
- `socket.io-client` for realtime communication with server

The above diagrams may not cover up the entire functionality, such as firing of `game:join` event from the client side.

### TODO

- Add 'Rematch' feature
- Make it beyond 'invite-only'
- User Login/Signup functionality
- Add security to the platform
